## Description ##

This project involves building a Dining Concierge chatbot using natural language processing (NLP) and deploying it as a serverless, microservice-driven web application. The chatbot will provide restaurant suggestions based on the preferences of the user. The project has several requirements, including building and deploying the frontend of the application using AWS S3 bucket, setting up the API using API Gateway and Swagger specification, creating a Lambda function for the chat operation, building the Dining Concierge chatbot using Amazon Lex, integrating the chatbot into the chat API using the AWS SDK, collecting 5,000+ random restaurants from Manhattan using the Yelp API, and storing the restaurants in a DynamoDB table named "yelp-restaurants" and an ElasticSearch index called "restaurants." The project is aimed at disrupting the customer service industry using NLP-powered applications.
